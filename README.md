Examples-of-codes
---

This repository is for simple and educational codes in several different languages. I occasionally upload some code here. Our goal is to learn, let's learn!



Brief description of the languages used[^1]
---


C
---
> C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions.


cs
---

> C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented, and component-oriented programming disciplines.

Erlang
---

> Erlang is a general-purpose, concurrent, functional programming language, and a garbage-collected runtime system.

Rust
---

> Rust is a modern systems programming language focusing on safety and speed.
> It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using garbage collection.
> “The Rust Programming Language” is split into three sections, which you can navigate through the menu on the left."

Python
---

> Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.
> Python is free and easy to learn.

* [Project Euler](./Project%20Euler/)

[^1]: I do not know all these languages! Probably no one can learn all these languages completely. I am new to some of these languages or familiar with the syntax of that language. My suggestion to you is to learn only one language to start (it does not matter which one you just start) and whenever you need to switch to another language, then you will learn a new language!
